#Team Charter - Cresa 9-1-1

###<u>Purpose Statement and Team Objectives</u>:

Our team was formed by instructor Chris Martin for the purpose of building team skills, mastering course material, and demonstrating that mastery which will culminate in a final project created for Web Design 2 (CGT 206) at Clark College. We are committed to building on our current knowledge, teaching each other, and learning from each other.

Our team will be building a website for [Cresa 9-1-1][cresa] to replace their existing site. We hope to deliver the client a responsive design that is user friendly (easy to use with intuitive navigation and heavily tested prior to delivery to avoid problems), and works on any device and/or browser. 

We are going to rock the 9-1-1 site! We will be professional. We will have fun!

###<u>Analysis of Strengths and Developmental Needs</u>:
After discussing the classes our team has taken previous to this course, skill sets, prior life experiences, personality traits, and level of commitment to the project we were able to determine our strengths and needs. We recognize that our needs may change as we have more information about the client’s requirements for the project.
**Strengths**:
- **Knowledge and Skills:**
   Everyone on the team has had some experience with html5, css3, Photoshop, and Illustrator. All team members know how to do research and have had some experience with user experience design. More than half the team has had some skill with multiple languages (Python, JavaScript, php, etc.). Our team leader has extensive knowledge of and passion for the development tools we will be using for this project. Every team member has expressed a willingness eagerness to share knowledge with the other members of the team. We all expect to learn as we work on the project.
- **Background and Experience:**
   In addition to our experiences at Clark College, each of our team members brings life experiences from previous projects/work which will be an asset to the team. Multiple team members have successfully worked for clients on past projects.
- **Interpersonal Skills:**
   This team has great communication skills. Each member has a great sense of humor which we feel will be an asset in the coming weeks. Each team member also has a high level of commitment to the project. 66% of the team is confident in their people skills. Each member has exhibited a willingness to be flexible, punctual, and communicate if any issues arise. 33% of the group is organized and will attempt to assist the other 66.99% with their organizational skills for this project.

**Development Needs:**
- **Lack of Skills:**
   Some team members have not worked with some of the technology we will be using for the project before. For example, at least one member will need to learn to successfully use gitHUB. In addition, we expect each member to learn at least one new skill (see Team Objectives) while working on this project.

###<u>Functional Roles</u>:
Team Leader: Jino Conklin
Project Manager: Christine Watson
Communications: David Larson
Master Developer: Jino Conklin
Front End Dev. & Design: Christine Watson
QA & Testing: David Larson

###<u>Team Process Management</u>:
####Team Meetings:
We will have co-op style team meetings regularly (as needed) to discuss our progress on the project. Meetings may be held on campus, off campus, or online as needed. Each meeting will have an agenda agreed upon at the beginning of the meeting. Each team member will be required to give a progress report and communicate their next steps. All members are expected to arrive on time, be respectful, and participate at every meeting. Constructive criticism is encouraged. We will have a teaching/learning atmosphere as well.

####Decision Making Procedure:
 We will have open conversation including opinions from all team members. We will listen to each other’s ideas before making a group decision. If the group is unable to agree, the team leader will have final say. We will ask each other questions. We will ask each other for help as needed. We will give honest feedback. We will not tolerate belittling or harsh words.

####Team Communication:
We will communicate with each other via email, phone, text, google+, google hangouts, github, skype, and smoke signal if need be. Every team member will be expected to reply to communication in a reasonable time frame. We will utilize a shared Google calendar to communicate team member availability.

   We will communicate with every other team member if we will be late or unable to attend a meeting or deadline. We will always be professional and respectful in our communications. Our communications specialist, David Larson, will ensure we stay in touch and respectful.

   We decided that it would serve the client best if only one team member contacts the client between meetings. The Project Manager, Christine, will take on this role. If any team member has an issue that needs to be brought to the client before the next scheduled client meeting, they will communicate the issue to Christine who will create one compiled list of issues before contacting the client by phone or email as appropriate.

####Team Roles:
<em>Team Leader</em> will guide meetings and ensure each team member is meeting their goals, participating in group discussions, and new assignments are delegated to keep us at a pace to meet our deadlines.

<em>Project Manager</em> will create all documents associated with the project and maintain contact with the client. All documentation will be sent in a timely manner to the team members for revisions and updates to ensure we have the accurate documentation for class and client. Project Manager will take notes at meetings and send the notes to the team.

<em>Communications Specialist</em> will ensure the team follows the guidelines set forth by the team to create a respectful, healthy, learning/teaching, and productive team dynamic. He will also make sure we are all staying in contact with each other every step of the way through the project.

<em>Master Developer</em> will make the final decision on all things developed for the project client, and will have final say on work produced or not by the team for the client. He will be responsible for all of the project development being completed on time. (In other words: He’s the boss, and we’re okay with that because he’s going to write the majority of the code required too.)

<em>Front End Dev. & Design</em> will design a site (look and feel of the site, user friendly navigation, etc.) based on group research, client feedback, and user experience design principles.

<em>QA & Testing</em> will be responsible for ensuring the client is getting the website they want (and we agreed to create) in a timely manner without any bugs. We acknowledge extensive testing will be required in order to accomplish this goal.

####Expectations of Team Members:
**Attendance:**
Attendance is expected for every meeting. If a member is going to be later or not able to attend a meeting they should let the other members know as soon as possible.  If a group member does not communicate that they will be late or unable to attend OR if a group member simply does not show up, we will implement our discipline policy.
- First Offense: Team member will bring treats to our next meeting. 
- Second Offense: The other team members will begin a log for performance review. This log will be used to show if the team member improved performance after the second offense or if they continued to slack. This will affect their grade in class.
- Third Offense: We feel confident it won’t happen. It will fall to the team leader to make a decision.

**Participation:**
All members are expected to participate fully. Not participating or communicating well may lead to the offending member being disciplined (see above). Each team member will be expected to meet deadlines and learning goals in a timely manner. To encourage team participation we will communicate with each other with “How are you doing?” emails. We will also have lots of mini-deadlines using the issue tracker in github. The team leader will set a 48 hour timer in github for updates. If any team member feels another team member is not pulling their weight or meeting their deadlines, they will confront the offending team member. If there is not a resolution, they may bring it up at the next meeting. If there is a problem we will begin the performance log discussed earlier.

**General Courtesy and Respect**
It is very important to us that we treat each other with respect. We will behave professionally. We will not belittle anyone or use harsh words. Constructive criticism is okay. We will respect each other by communicating often and with encouraging words. We will help each other.

###<u>Assessment of Team Effectiveness</u>:
At the end of each meeting we will discuss our progress, what needs to be done next, and make assignments to meet our next goal(s). (Did we meet our previous goals? What do we need to do next? Are we on target to meet our deadlines for class and client? Do we have everything we need?) If needed, we will discuss group dynamics (issues that may arise).

At the end of our project, we will assess our project and team. Did we meet these criteria?
- Did we rock the 9-1-1 site?
- Were we professional?
- Did we have fun?
- Did we use a combination of the knowledge we came to the team with and build on that to learn more, teach each other, and learn from each other to create a website for Cresa 9-1-1?
- Did we create a responsive design that is easy to use and works with any device or browser?
- Did we meet the client’s needs and wants within our abilities?
- Does Chris like the site?
- Does the class like the site?
- Did we adequately communicate with each other?
- Was a performance log created? And if yes, has the group member improved?
- Would we do it again?

In addition to answering those questions, we will give each other constructive honest feedback about what we did well and what we can improve on. We would also like to ask the class for a constructive critique.
